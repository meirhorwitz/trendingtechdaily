# 2. JOBS: A sequence of tasks to be executed

    # Use the latest version of Ubuntu for the virtual machine
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # 3. STEPS: The individual commands to run
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository code
      # This downloads your code into the virtual machine so it can be used.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      # Firebase tools require Node.js to run.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use a current LTS version of Node.js

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      # Assumes you have a package.json file. If not, you can remove this step.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Build your project
      # This command compiles your code into static files.
      # IMPORTANT: If your project doesn't have a build step or uses a different command
      # (e.g., 'CI=false npm run build'), you should adjust this line.
      # If you are just deploying static HTML/CSS/JS, you can remove this step.
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
      # This is the core step that sends your built code to Firebase.
      - name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
        uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          # This secret contains the JSON key for a Google Service Account
          # with the "Firebase Hosting Admin" role.
          firebaseServiceAccount: '${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TRENDINGTECH_DAILY }}'
          
          # This is your Firebase Project ID.
          projectId: 'trendingtech-daily'
          
          # Optional: specify the channel ID for preview deployments.
          # channelId: live
